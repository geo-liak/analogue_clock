# Analogue clock  

## About  

This is a project made with Javascript. The purpose was to practice with Javascript and canvas.  

This approach relies on JavaScript to create all the elements of the analogue clock.  

The only hard-coded variable is the canvas size, assuming a square canvas. If this is changed, all the elements of the analogue clock will change proportionately.  

## Preview
